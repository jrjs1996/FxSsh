This file contains information on how to replicate a test scenario for this Ssh Server.

Setup:

This setup was conducted using a windows desktop computer to run the server on connected
to a laptop running linux via ethernet cable. The version of SSH on the linux computer
may not support reverse connections. So you should run the command:"sudo apt-get install ssh".
Before testing to make sure it is installed. You should also make sure any ports on both
machines that will be used in this test are open. Also both machines should be on the same
subnet. In this test I use a simple python HTTP server on the linux machine that will be
communicated with via the reverse connection. Create a file called index.html and write
"Message from client" in it. Save the file then run the command "python3 -m http.server".
The http server should be up and running. For this example the IP address on my desktop
on the wired connection is 169.254.73.253 and 169.253.73.20 on my laptop.

Testing:

Start the SshServerLoader on the windows machine.

On the linux machine run the command ssh -R 8000:localhost:8000 root@169.254.73.253
(Replace the ip after root@ with your the IP on your windows machine)

You should see something similar to this on your SshServerLoader console:

Accepted a client.
Session E0186DF95A42425A78AEF277FB45F0B31BAB42E5 requesting UserauthService.
Session E0186DF95A42425A78AEF277FB45F0B31BAB42E5 requesting ConnectionService.
Channel 0 runs command: "shell".

Enter the following command into the SshserverLoader console:
Connect root

On the SshServerloader console you should see something similar to:
HTTP/1.0 200 OK
Server: SimpleHTTP/0.6 Python/3.5.2
